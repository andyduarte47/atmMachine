# Description and Motivation
The User will be able to make multiple accounts by signing up. Login and logout of those accounts. Make a Deposit/Withdraw when the user is logged in. Update their own pin and even delete their own accounts.

## Milestone 1  1 day
Initial setup and landing page
I will start of buying getting down the basics of spring from using Spring initializr, Adding a controller with a route to handle "/", Creating a template for the landing page, and pushing it to github. I will also make a static landing page that list the deetails of the project.


## Milestone 2 4-6 days
Add a couple of extra routes that build dynamic pages based on data from a database.
On this day, I will work on the databas that will keep track with the user first name, last name, User ID, pin, and account balance. I will be working with @entity to represent the domain data, add database dependencies, create/configure SQL migrations, CrudRepository, @Controller to handle routes for list pages and detail pages, and create templates for those pages. This will also work with the display/check option 

## Milestone 3 1-2 days
Get the user to be able to sign up, login, and logout.
By this time I want to be able to make a sign up page and a login/logout page.
The site will ask to sign up. When signing up you will be making an account it will ask for your first/last name, userID, and pin. Once you create an account you will not be able to deposit, withdraw, Check balance, display accounts, delete accounts, and changer pin number.

## Milestone 4 Remaining Days.IO
One Feature I will add is letting the user be able to change their pin number, when they are not logged in. I did not have this feauture in my unit project. Just like many people forget their password logging in to other sites. I want to make it to where the user puts in more personal information so they are able to change their pin number.
